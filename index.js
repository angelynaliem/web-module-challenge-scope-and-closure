/**
 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * Counter1 has 2 functions and declares a variable inside the first function, and accesses that variable in the other function.
 * Counter2 accesses the variable that is declared outside of it.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * Both use closure. Counter2 is more obvious, counter1 uses closure in the second function because it accesses the variable in the first function.
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *Counter1 code would be preferable if we don't need the variable 'count' to be a global variable. Counter2 would be better if we need to access the variable 'count' in other places because it is set as a global variable.

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that generates a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

function inning(/*Code Here*/){

    /*Code Here*/

}

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return: 
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

*/

  /*Code Here*/

}

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `inning` that you wrote above
(2) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:

1st inning: 0 - 2
2nd inning: 1 - 3
3rd inning: 1 - 3
4th inning: 2 - 4
5th inning: 4 - 6
6th inning: 4 - 6
7th inning: 4 - 6
8th inning: 5 - 8
9th inning: 6 - 10

Final Score: 6 - 10 */
